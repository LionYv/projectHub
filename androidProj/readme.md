Project name: "MatchDay"
this is my 12th grade project i made a year ago.
it is an app called "MatchDay", the idea behind the app is to give the user an access to live and updating information about his football games happening currently, 
including detailed information about his favorite team.
the app includes multiple functions such as:
1. live updates about games happening right now - this is made possible due to a technique i used called "web-scraping" with the help of the jsoup library 
2. viewing your favorite team upcoming fixtures.
3. having a guesser leaderboard which is platform-wide using google firebase. the user with most correct guesses will be on top of the leaderboard.
4. viewing past guesses of a user - saved in google firebase database.
